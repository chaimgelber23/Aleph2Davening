    // BEGINNER LEVEL - Simple, encouraging, not overwhelming
    beginnerSummary:
      'When you wake up in the morning, Jews wash their hands with water. This is a simple way to start your day fresh and ready for prayer.',
    beginnerWhy:
      'Jewish tradition teaches that sleep is like a mini-death - our soul goes up to Heaven and comes back refreshed. Washing hands in the morning is a way of saying "I\'m starting a new day, and I want to be spiritually clean and ready." It\'s based on a verse in Psalms: "I wash my hands in purity."',
    beginnerHow:
      'When you wake up, fill a cup with water and pour it over each hand - right, left, right, left. Dry your hands. Done! As you get more comfortable, you can learn the traditional way with 3 times on each hand.',

      'Jewish tradition teaches that when we sleep, a spiritual impurity rests on our hands. By washing them in a specific way, we start our day fresh and pure — ready to serve Hashem with clean hands and a clear heart. It is one of the first acts of a Jew each morning.',

    beginnerWhy:
      'In the Temple, the priests would ritually wash before eating holy bread. When we wash before eating bread, we\'re bringing that holiness into our own homes. Your kitchen table becomes like an altar, your meal becomes like a Temple offering.',

      'Before eating bread, wash your hands at the sink with a cup. Pour water over each hand twice (right, left, right, left). Then say the blessing - you can start in English: "Thank you God for the mitzvah of washing hands." Dry your hands, say the blessing over bread (Hamotzi), and eat.
