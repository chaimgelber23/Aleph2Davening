# Complete Amud Preparation System

## Overview

A **4-level progressive disclosure system** that teaches everyone to understand and lead davening, from absolute beginners to people preparing to lead their first service.

### The Problem You Identified

> "Make sure that in amud mode they know what will be so they have to know the complete scope of the prayer and also the details in each part. If it's too simple which I don't know if it is then it might fall short."

**Your concern was valid.** A simple overview isn't enough for someone preparing to lead. They need:
- ✅ **Complete scope** - the full picture upfront
- ✅ **Detailed breakdowns** - exact text, exact timing, exact responses
- ✅ **No surprises** - all variations visible before they start

## The Solution: 4-Level Progressive System

Like your Daily Living Guides (Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced), the amud system now has **4 levels** that users can choose based on their needs:

### Level 1: Learn the Roles (📚 Guide Mode)
**For:** First-timers, people who have never been to a traditional service
**Time:** 5 min read

**What it shows:**
- Explanation of the 4 prayer roles:
  - 🎙️ **Shaliach Tzibbur** (Prayer Leader) - leads aloud
  - 👥 **Congregation** - everyone says together
  - 🎵 **Together** - leader and congregation in unison
  - 🤫 **Silent** - individual quiet prayer
- Why these roles matter
- How they work in practice
- Beginner-friendly language: "Shaliach Tzibbur means 'messenger of the congregation'"

**Purpose:** Foundation. Understand the basics before seeing the flow.

---

### Level 2: Quick Path (🗺️ Roadmap Mode)
**For:** People who want to understand the service flow or prepare casually
**Time:** 10 min review

**What it shows:**
- Step-by-step flow of the service (10-13 steps)
- Your role at each step (Lead / Silent / Together / Respond)
- Key moments: "This is when you call out Barechu"
- Today's variations highlighted in amber:
  - ⚠️ "Add Ya'aleh V'yavo today"
  - ✓ "Skip Tachnun today"
- Tips: "Wait for the congregation here"
- Preparation notes before you begin

**Example Output:**
```
1. 🤫 SILENT - Opening Blessings
   💡 You prepare yourself at your seat

2. 🎙️ YOU LEAD - Barechu
   💡 Your first public moment. Say clearly and wait for response.

3. 👥 TOGETHER - Shema & Blessings
   💡 Cover your eyes during first verse

4. 🤫 SILENT - Silent Amidah
   💡 Take 3 steps forward, stand with feet together

5. ⚠️ IMPORTANT - Add Ya'aleh V'yavo [HIGHLIGHTED]

6. 🎙️ YOU LEAD - Chazzan's Repetition
   💡 Say slowly, wait for Amens

7. ✓ Skip Tachnun Today [HIGHLIGHTED]
```

**Purpose:** The roadmap. See the journey from 30,000 feet.

### Level 3: Full Scope (🎯 Complete Picture)

    - "🔴 Bow when you say Barechu"
    - "Wait for congregation at Y'hei sh'mei raba"
    - "Do NOT pause between Shema and Emet V'Yatziv"
  - **Common mistakes to avoid:**
    - "× Forgetting to bow"
    - "× Not waiting for Amens"
    - "× Accidentally starting Tachnun on days we skip it"
- **Conditional sections highlighted:**

## Calendar Integration - Today's Variations

**All 4 levels** are calendar-aware and automatically show today's variations:

### Calendar Rules Implemented:

| Occasion | Tachnun | Hallel | Mussaf | Ya'aleh V'yavo | Notes |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|----------------|-------|
| **Regular Weekday** | ✓ (short) | - | - | - | Normal service |
| **Monday/Thursday** | ✓ (LONG) | - | - | - | Extended Tachnun with extra verses |
| **Rosh Chodesh** | ✗ | Half | ✓ | ✓ | No Tachnun, add prayers |
| **Chanukah** | ✗ | Full | - | - | Full Hallel, no Tachnun |
| **Fast Days** | ✗ (Selichot instead) | - | - | ✓ (Aneinu) | Special prayers |
| **Purim** | ✗ | - | - | - | No Tachnun |
| **Tu B'Shvat / Lag B'Omer / Tu B'Av** | ✗ | - | - | - | No Tachnun |
| **Month of Nissan** | ✗ | - | - | - | No Tachnun all month |
| **Yamim Tovim** | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Full festival service |

**How it works:**
```typescript
const variations = getTodaysServiceVariations(new Date());

variations.hasTachnun          // true/false
variations.hasLongTachnun      // true on Mon/Thu if Tachnun is said
variations.hasHallel           // true on Rosh Chodesh, holidays
variations.hallelType          // 'full' or 'half'
variations.hasYaalehVeyavo     // true on Rosh Chodesh, Yom Tov
variations.hasMussaf           // true on Rosh Chodesh, Shabbat, Yom Tov
variations.isRoshChodesh       // true if today is Rosh Chodesh
variations.isFastDay           // true if today is a fast day
variations.notes               // ["Rosh Chodesh: No Tachnun", ...]
```

**Examples:**

**Monday (Regular):**
```
Today's Notes:
- Regular weekday: Tachnun is recited
- Monday/Thursday: Extended Tachnun with additional verses

Path shows: Standard service + LONG Tachnun section
```

**Rosh Chodesh (any day):**
```
Today's Notes:
- Rosh Chodesh: No Tachnun today
- Say Half Hallel after Shacharit
- Lead Mussaf after the main service

Path shows:
✓ Skip Tachnun [HIGHLIGHTED]
+ Half Hallel section [HIGHLIGHTED]
+ Mussaf section [HIGHLIGHTED]
⚠️ Add Ya'aleh V'yavo [HIGHLIGHTED]
```

**15th of Nissan (Pesach):**

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
src/components/daven/
├── AmudCue.tsx                    # Inline cue component
│   └── AmudRolesGuide             # Level 1: Guide
├── TodaysServicePath.tsx          # Level 2: Quick Path
├── ServiceScopeOverview.tsx       # Level 3: Full Scope
├── ServiceRehearsalScript.tsx     # Level 4: Rehearsal
├── AmudPreparation.tsx            # Main component with level selector
└── PrayerReader.tsx               # Prayer display with amud cues

src/lib/calendar/
└── service-calendar.ts            # Calendar logic for variations
```

### Usage

**In a page:**
```tsx
import AmudPreparation from '@/components/daven/AmudPreparation';

export default function PrepPage() {
  return <AmudPreparation defaultLevel="quick" />;
}
```

**The component handles:**
- Level selection UI
- Rendering the appropriate view
- Progress recommendations ("Ready for more detail?")
- Encouragement at each stage

---

## Comparison: Before vs After

### BEFORE (Your Concern)
- ❌ Too simple - just a high-level path
- ❌ No details on exact text
- ❌ No timing estimates
- ❌ Missing the "complete scope"
- ❌ Might fall short for serious preparation

### AFTER (Current System)
- ✅ **4 levels** of progressive detail
- ✅ **Complete scope** visible upfront (Level 3)
- ✅ **Word-for-word script** available (Level 4)
- ✅ **Exact timing** for every section
- ✅ **All variations** shown based on calendar
- ✅ **Critical moments** highlighted
- ✅ **Common mistakes** warned
- ✅ **No surprises** - everything disclosed

---

## Design Philosophy

### Borrowed from Your Guide System

Just like your Daily Living Guides have:
- **Beginner** - Simple, encouraging, practical
- **Intermediate** - Traditional methods
- **Advanced** - Complete halachic detail

The Amud System has:
- **Learn** - Understand the basics
- **Quick** - See the path
- **Full** - Know the scope
- **Rehearsal** - Practice the words

### Key Principles

1. **Progressive disclosure** - Start simple, add complexity as needed
2. **User choice** - Let them pick their level
3. **Complete transparency** - No hidden details at higher levels
4. **Calendar-aware** - Automatically adjust for today
5. **Encouraging tone** - "You've got this!" not "You'll mess up"
6. **Visual hierarchy** - Icons, colors, borders for quick scanning
7. **Practical focus** - What you'll DO, not just what you should know

---

## What This Solves

### For Absolute Beginners
- Understand what's happening in shul
- Know when to stand, sit, respond
- Follow along without feeling lost

### For People Preparing to Lead (Casually)
- See the roadmap
- Know the key moments
- Understand today's variations

### For Serious Preparation (Your Concern)
- **Complete scope** - total time, all sections, all variations
- **Detailed breakdowns** - what's in each section, how long, what to watch for
- **Full script** - every word, every pause, every response
- **No surprises** - calendar auto-adjusts, conditional sections highlighted
- **Common mistakes** - warned before they happen

### For Regular Leaders
- Quick reference for today's variations
- Reminder of calendar-specific additions
- Refresh on timing and flow

---

## Conclusion

You were right to be concerned. A simple path isn't enough for someone truly preparing to lead.

Now they have:
- 📚 **Understanding** of the liturgical structure
- 🗺️ **Roadmap** of the service flow
- 🎯 **Complete scope** with all details visible upfront
- 📜 **Full script** to practice word-for-word

**No one will be caught off-guard. No one will fall short.**

The system meets them where they are and gives them exactly what they need - whether that's basic orientation or complete preparation for leading their first service.
